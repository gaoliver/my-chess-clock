# My Chess Clock

Challenging project by Gabriel Ramos to Dept Agency.

<br>

## About

This project was made using libraries:

- Expo
- Redux
- Native Base
- ESLint with Prettier
- React Navigation

<br>

## Explaining usage

**Expo:** The best choice for a better experience using the app while in development. With Expo you can run the app easy on your machine as much as on your smartphone.

**Redux:** Used for state management, all the configuration of this app, which the user can create or edit, is saved locally using Redux and AsyncStorage.

**Native Base:** On this project, Native Base is being used for the most primitive and commonly used components those need to follow patterns. As having only one week for developing this app, a library like this for using some few components (like header) was very important for saving time.

**ESLing with Prettier:** Every project developed in team must have a way for making some code format pattern, so the risks will be lower when merging branches and commits. And for helping it to be cleaner and most beautiful, this project is using Prettier as extension.

**React Navigation:** As default and highly recommended by the React Native and Expo projects, React Navigation is connecting all screens inside this project and manages all navigations.

# How to run

Assuming that you have Node 12 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

```shell
npm install -g expo-cli
```

And for running the project itself, just run the following command:

```shell
yarn && yarn start
```

Expo helps you to run it in you machine or smartphone devices as well. You just need to install Expo app on your device and scan the QR Code that is going to appear on you terminal or on the browser which automatically is going to be opened by Expo after you run it.
